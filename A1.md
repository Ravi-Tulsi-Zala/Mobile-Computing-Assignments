**Application Report**

In the fast-paced world, people do not have enough time to get to a library and find the book. That is the reason why the e-library or digital borrowing concept came into existence. Libby is a reading app to unify the experience of browsing, borrowing, reading digital books and listening audiobooks from the libraryâ€™s OverDrive collection. Every library's OverDrive collection is slightly different because each library picks the digital content they want for their users[a]. The concept of "Digital Borrowing" seemed exciting and innovative for research. In addition to it, its artistic user interface makes it easier for users to get the most out of the application[b].

Libby allows readers to navigate and browse more efficiently across multiple local libraries with one or more library cards, and manage all the books and audiobooks in one place. Moreover, this app also facilitates the user, with the options like Kindle and Adobe Compatible Reader, to read the books on preferable devices. The Libby app is available on all the mobile platforms[c]. Libby used APIs of its parent company, Overdrive, for the features like search books (Search API), library availability (Library Availability API), check holds (Holds API). It is using  Mapbox API and Mapbox Gl JS to integrate OpenStreetMap functionality to search the local libraries in the city. Furthermore, it is now possible to listen to audiobooks in the car through Android Auto API in a recent update[d].

Some vital features of the Libby are Stay signed in to multiple libraries using different library cards, Download Books and Audiobooks for offline reading, Keep track of holds and loans, a shelf, Send to Kindle option is also readily available. The most notable feature in the application is Tags. Tags are a flexible way to organize books with titles as finished, want to read, thriller, or hated. However, Libby users faced some issues too, for example, user's local library wishlist will not appear in Libby, Lacks the accessibility or multilingual features, Can't get on the hold for a title at more than one library[e]. To make this application better, there are quite a few suggestions like including a sign-out option, wishlists feature, Recommend a book to a local library, Syncing tags across devices[f].

**Application Report**

The iPhone has Siri, Amazon has Alexa, and Microsoft has Cortana, but Google has a voice-activated virtual assistant of its own. It is an evolution of Android features like Google Now digital assistant and Google Allo messaging application. Google Assistant is more conversational and exclusively available to Google Allo. Moreover, It provides contextual information and performs actions such as setting a timer,  play some music, set the alarm, booking a flight and a lot of other things. It can also do wonders with integrating google assistant with smart home(Google Home), car(Android Auto), smartwatch, laptop(Pixelbook), Android TV[a]. The motivation behind choosing  Google Assistant for research is because of its usage of  Artificial Intelligence and Automation concepts. Artificial Intelligence played an essential role in transforming the smart devices[b].

In the modern era, from booking a table at any restaurant to scheduling an appointment for a haircut is possible with voice commands and text commands on a single Android application. Google Assitant makes it possible for an individual to perform actions on behalf. For example, Say "Ok Google" , "Set a timer for 5 minutes please". It will pop up one window and will set up a timer for the specified time. Customers connected to the Google Ecosystem and Smart home enthusiasts can use Google Assistant to automate various parts of daily lives. Google Assistant enabled Google Home can identify multiple users' commands, provides proactive responses, and also show visual responses to a user's connected televisions, smartphones, and laptops, while also being able to stream music[c].

Artificial Intelligence components like Deep learning, Speech to Text, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Hybrid Neural Networks were used in Google Assistant. The core technology behind the Google Assistant's phone calls to book an appointment for a haircut, reserving a table at a restaurant is Google Duplex technology.  Google Duplex is a recurrent neural network that can be trained for highly specialized tasks, and it uses Google's Speech Recognition technology to interface with a user. Wavenet, Google's DeepMind division's AI-based program, help Duplex to sound a lot closer to a human than ever before, including "mm-hmms, aahs, umms"[d].

Google assistant sends a notification and a calendar entry when an appointment is booked,  a user sets a timer and a reminder. Most important thing is the user has all the control and freedom of information shared with Google. Google assistant understands the context or nuances to the most extent that too with multilingual abilities. An individual can play games on it, has the freedom to change the voice of assistant, can create a routine for daily news, can customize the assistant. Assistant can send daily traffic notifications. It forgets the context when throwing a chain of questions to it and also needs the access to user's data to better intelligence[e]. Google assistant can be improved by adding new Google Wakewords(Ok Google) like Hey Google, Hey There. Google could use deeper AI to make the Assistant intelligent enough to answer the questions[f].
